So many years have passed,  
And all the sufferings've been overcomed,  
Yet how much darkness must a man breakthrough,  
Before there comes to him the dreaming light.  

So many years have passed,  
And all the sad stories've been forgotten,  
Yet how many tears must a man swallow,  
Before they really call him a man.  

So many years have passed,  
And all the pains've been dimmed,  
Yet how many achievements must a man achieve,  
Before they don't consider him useless anymore.  

So many years have passed,  
And all the loneliness's been tasted,  
Yet how many nights must a man stay up alone,  
Before he can face death without pity.
